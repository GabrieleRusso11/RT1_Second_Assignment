    listen for User Interface node

    take sensor data from the laser scan and save 
    each data in the ranges array (size = 720)

    Save ranges array data from 0 to 320 in right_side array
    and evaluate the minimum value.

    Save ranges array data from 320 to 400 in front_side array
    and evaluate the minimum value.

    Save ranges array data from 400 to 720 in left_side array
    and evaluate the minimum value.
